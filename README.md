# SoloBolo
A simple learning language app, which would provide you with an easy way to pick up your French where you left it off.

# Installation Guide
Simply download the APK file to your phone and install it by going to your File Manager and clicking on the file name.

# Usage
If you are using SoloBolo for the first time, then go ahead and sign up for free. If not, sign in and proceed with selecting a word from a given category you wish to learn in French. At the moment, there are 4 categories: Numbers, Family Members, Colors, Phrases. In each category, there is a picture of each word (except for Phrases), as well as the transcription of the word in French and in English. Additionally, with a click on the word, there is a pronunciation of the word in French. That's everything that there is to it. Start clicking and start learning. Moreover, you can choose to leave a review, made up of a personal comment and a 1-5 star rating. Reviews are limited to 1 review per account. If you have left a bad review (or a good one), and later on have changed your mind, you can always remove your previous review from the Reviews sections in the toolbar and write a new one. Happy learning!
